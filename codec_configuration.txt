TSCS454 (Redwood) CODEC Configuration:

Prequisites:

    1. TSCS454 CODEC properly interfaced to an SOC of your choice
    2. Linux Kernel with the TSCS454 Kernel module
    3. Device Tree description as described in the binding
    4. amixer

Terminology:

    Required - Denotes a control that must be set for proper operation

    Depends  - Denotes a control that depends on another control about whether
                   its configuration is needed.

Tips:

    Save configuration
    
        Once the mixer settings are set appropriately for your application you
        can use the following command to save the state.

            alsactl store

        This will store the state of the mixer controls to a file with the
        following path.

            /etc/asound.state

        For a production system you should generate this file for the rootfs
        image that will be copied to each device.

Internal Path Considerations:

	Internally the TSCS454 CODEC has audio data paths that transfer multi
	channel audio. There are a maximum of 6 channels of audio. Depending on
	how the CODEC is configured different sources will source the data for
	each of the 6 channels. Channels are grouped into the following pairs:

		CH 1_2
		CH 3_4
		CH 5_6

	Examples:

		All interfaces are configured for I2S:

			DAI 1 ==> CH 1_2
			DAI 2 ==> CH 3_4
			DAI 3 ==> CH 5_6

		DAI 1 configured for TDM with 2 slots and DAI 2 & 3 configured
		for I2S:

			DAI 1 (TDM Slot 1 & 2) ==> CH 1_2
			DAI 2 ==> CH 3_4
			DAI 3 ==> CH 5_6

		DAI 1 configured for TDM with 4 slots and DAI 3 configured for
		I2S:

			DAI 1 (TDM Slot 1 & 2) ==> CH 1_2
			DAI 1 (TDM Slot 3 & 4) ==> CH 3_4 
			DAI 3 ==> CH 5_6

		DAI 1 configured for TDM with 6 slots:

			DAI 1 (TDM Slot 1 & 2) ==> CH 1_2
			DAI 1 (TDM Slot 3 & 4) ==> CH 3_4 
			DAI 1 (TDM Slot 5 & 6) ==> CH 5_6 

	Note: The TSCS454 also provides PCM interfacing on DAI 2 & 3. This is a
	subset of TDM with two channels, so the driver treats PCM configurations
	like TDM with 2 slots. In the above examples if an interface was
	configured for PCM (i.e. 2 slot TDM) it would behave similarly to an
	I2S configuration.

Configurations:

    This section will demonstrate how to enable various paths on the TSCS454
    CODEC. Each path is enabled with a set of amixer commands that execute in
    series. You can combine these command sets in to one script file that
    achieves your desired configuration.

    Note: Not all paths can be combined.

    Internal Rate (Required):

        Options: '44.1kHz', '48kHz'

        Example: amixer set 'Internal Rate' '48kHz'

        Note: This control works in conjunction with the 'Internal Rate
        Multiple' control to generate the CODEC's internal sampling rate. Once
        the CODEC's internal sample rate is configured any interface that is
        opened must be opened at the internal rate or use the asynchronous
        sample rate converter (ASRC). There is only one, so this configuration
        needs to be chosen carefully to meet your requirements.

    Internal Rate Multiple (Required):

        Options: '0.25x', '0.5x', '1.0x', '2.0x'

        Example:

            amixer set 'Internal Rate Multiple' '2.0x'

        Note: This control works in conjunction with the 'Internal Rate' control
        to generate the CODEC's internal sampling rate. Once the CODEC's
        internal sample rate is configured any interface that is opened must be
        opened at the internal rate or use the asynchronous sample rate
        converter (ASRC). There is only one, so this configuration needs to be
        chosen carefully to meet your requirements.

    ASRC In / ASRC Out (Depends):

        If an interface is needed at a particular sample rate that differs from
        the internal rate of the CODEC, then you will need to assign the ASRC to
        that interface. There is one for playback and one for capture. The
        following example assigns an ASRC to the playback and capture paths of
        DAI 2.

        Options: 'None', 'DAI 1', 'DAI 2', 'DAI 3'

        Example:

            amixer set 'ASRC In' 'DAI 2' 
            amixer set 'ASRC Out' 'DAI 2'

    Headphone Playback:

        This example will configure the following path:

        DAI 2 ---> Headphone  

        amixer set 'DAC Mux' 'CH 2_3'
        amixer set 'Headphone' '50%'
        amixer set 'DAC Mute' 'off'
        
    Speaker Playback:

        This example will configure the following path:

        DAI 1 ---> Speaker

        amixer set 'Speaker Mux' 'CH 0_1'
        amixer set 'Speaker' '50%'
        amixer set 'Speaker Mute' 'off'
        
    Analog Capture:

        This example will configure the following path:

        amixer set 'Input Boost Channel 0 Mux' 'Input 1'
        amixer set 'Input Boost Channel 1 Mux' 'Input 1'
        amixer set 'Input Boost Channel 0' '20dB'
        amixer set 'Input Boost Channel 1' '20dB'
        amixer set 'ADC Channel 0 Mux' 'Input Boost'
