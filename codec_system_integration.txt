TSCS454 (Redwood) CODEC System Configuration:

Considerations:

    Internal rate, interface rate, and asyncronouse sample rate converter (ASRC)

    Before integrating the TSCS454 CODEC in your system you should consider
    what the sample rate requirements of your application are. The CODEC can
    support a wide range of sample rates, but the integrator will need to choose
    what the internal rate of the CODEC should be. Once this is chosen the
    interfaces on the CODEC will only work correctly if their rate matches that
    of the internal rate unless the ASRC is assigned to that interface. There is
    only one ASRC, so careful planning is required to choose which interace will
    use the ASRC. All other interfaces will need to match the internal rate.

    If an application needs to dynamically assign the ASRC to different
    interfaces this is possible by changing the mixer setting for the ASRC In or
    ASRC Out depending on the direction of the stream.

    NOTE: For more information on assigning the ASRC see codec_configuration.txt
